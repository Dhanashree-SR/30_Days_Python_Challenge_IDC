## 💻 Challenge

> **Task**: Calculate the area of a rectangle using user-input length and width.  
> ✅ I implemented 5 versions of the code, including a bonus one that accepts units (like cm, m, in) and displays the final area accordingly.

## 💭 Reflection

Today was all about **getting hands-on with variables** and exploring **user input in Python**.  
I wrote multiple versions of the rectangle area calculator — from hardcoded values to dynamic user input and a final version with **custom units**.

✨ What I loved:
- F-strings are super clean and powerful!
- Asking for units added a real-world touch 💡
- Getting comfortable with basic Python syntax feels great

Step by step, building my coding muscle 💪  
On to Day 3 with excitement! 🚀
