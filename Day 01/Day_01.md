## 🗓️ Day 01 – Introduction & Hello World

### **✅ Task:**
Write a Python program that prints "Hello, World!" followed by your name.

### **💻 My Code:**

```python
name = "Dhanashree"
print(f"Hello, World! I'm {name}")
```

### **🧠 Concepts Learned:**

* Basic Python syntax
* `print()` function
* Variables and string storage
* String concatenation and `f-strings`

### **💡 Reflection:** <br/>

* Starting with “Hello, World!” was nostalgic. 
* It reminded me how every coder begins here — simple but meaningful.
* I’ve written this line before, but today it feels intentional.
* With this challenge, I’m not just learning Python — I’m building consistency, and that’s exciting.
