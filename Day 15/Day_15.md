# 📅 Day 15: Decorators in Python

## **🧠 Topics Covered**


Function decorators in Python

## How decorators work (higher-order functions)
Practical use cases like timing execution

## 🧪 Challenge
**Create a decorator to log function execution time.**

This challenge helps understand how decorators can wrap existing functions and add functionality (like measuring how long a function takes to run) without modifying the original function’s code.

## 🔍 What I Learned


- How to create a custom decorator using nested functions
- The time module for tracking function run durations
- Applying the decorator using @decorator_name syntax
- That decorators are super useful for logging, validation, or modifying behavior dynamically

## 💡 Use Cases
- Logging function usage in large projects
- Performance benchmarking
- Debugging and auditing behavior
