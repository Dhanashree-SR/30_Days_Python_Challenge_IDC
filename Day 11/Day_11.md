# 📅 Day 11: Working with Dates & Times — #30DaysOfPython

Welcome to Day 11 of my #30DaysOfPython challenge, where we explore how to work with dates and times using Python's `datetime` module.


## 🗓️ Concept

Handling date and time is crucial in real-world applications like logging, reports, reminders, deadlines, and more. Python provides a powerful `datetime` module that lets us create, manipulate, and format date and time objects.

## 🧠 Topics Covered

- Importing the `datetime` module
- Getting the current date and time
- Creating date objects
- Formatting dates
- Calculating time differences using `timedelta`


## 🧾 Syntax

```python
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

# Current date & time
now = datetime.now()

# Creating custom date
custom_date = datetime(2025, 6, 7)

# Calculating difference
diff = now - custom_date

# Formatting
formatted = now.strftime("%d-%m-%Y %H:%M:%S")
````


## 💡 Real-World Analogy

Think of `datetime` as your personal assistant who can not only tell you what time it is ⏰ but also how many days are left for your birthday 🎂 or calculate how long ago you last updated your resume 😂


## 🧪 Challenge

**Calculate the number of days between two dates**
