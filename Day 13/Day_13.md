## 📅 Day 13: Stack

### 📌 Topics Covered
- Stack data structure
- LIFO (Last-In-First-Out) principle
- Implementing Stack from scratch using Python
- CLI-based stack operations using `input()`

---

### 🧠 Key Concepts

- **push()** – Add element to the top  
- **pop()** – Remove top element  
- **peek()** – See the top element  
- **is_empty()** – Check if the stack is empty  

Stacks work like a pile of plates — add and remove only from the top.

---

### ✅ Challenge
**Implement a stack with push, pop, and peek methods using CLI input.**

### 📝 Notes

- Stack is widely used in:
  - Function call management (call stack)
  - Undo/Redo features in applications
  - Browser history navigation

- Python list makes it easy to implement stack operations  
- Good practice to handle empty stack conditions to avoid errors
