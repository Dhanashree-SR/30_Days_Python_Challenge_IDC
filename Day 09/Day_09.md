# 📘 Day 0️⃣9️⃣: Object-Oriented Programming (Part 2)

📅 **Date:** June 5, 2025

## 🗒️ Topics Covered

### 🔹 Inheritance

Inheritance allows one class (child) to derive the properties and methods of another class (parent). It promotes code reusability and scalability.

### 🔹 Polymorphism

Polymorphism allows the same method name to behave differently in different classes, making the code more flexible and maintainable.

## 🎯 Challenge Task

🔧 **Task:**
Build upon the previous `Car` class by creating an `ElectricCar` subclass.
The goal was to:

* Accept input from the user for multiple cars
* Include additional attributes like battery capacity for electric cars
* Override the `display_info()` method to reflect the uniqueness of electric vehicles
* Use a `for` loop to process multiple entries
